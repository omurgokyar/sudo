## What is CryptoSudo
CryptoSudo is the developing and education ecosystem on the basis of Blockchain Technology. Our base goal is to make this technology more understandable and create an effective community that will contribute to its development. 

We believe that the developers are critical value to Blockchain Technology. Our another goal is to bring new developers to this sector and help existing developers do their jobs well.

We will introduce an online and free training platform about the cryptography and software languages which are basis of this technology. And we will spread this platform to masses.

Our ecosystem will be a central development and education platform for Blockchain Technology, supported by SUDO crypto currency.
